<div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
  <p>
    Iâ€™ve kicked things off by creating the layout for a simple form. To avoid
    repeating the same markup over and over, I made the input a separate
    component â€” I meannn, thatâ€™s one of the many perks of using React ðŸ˜Œ.
  </p>
  <p>
    The entire layout is styled with TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive
    look.{" "}
  </p>
</div>

Hereâ€™s what the code and form looks like so far:

<div className="flex gap-4 mt-6">
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/pageCode.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/inputUI.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>

<div className="flex justify-center mt-5">
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/img1.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>


<div className="mt-5">
  <h3 className="mb-5">
    Next up, I set up state management for the form using Reactâ€™s useState hook.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Instead of creating a separate state for each input (which can quickly get
    messy), Iâ€™m keeping everything neat in a single formData object. Each input
    field is identified by a key (like "name", "email", etc.), and updated using
    a generic handler â€” handleInputChange.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="flex gap-4 mt-6">
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/handleFunc.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/inputComp.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>

<div className="mt-5">
  <p>So how does this work?</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
    <li>
      handleInputChange is the defining function; It receives the new value and
      a string identifier for the field being updated.
    </li>
    <li>
    In each input component, I pass onChangeHandler={(val) => handleInputChange(val, "fieldName")} â€” this is the calling function.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
