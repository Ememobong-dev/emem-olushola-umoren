Iâ€™ve kicked things off by creating the layout for a simple form. To avoid repeating the same markup over and over, I made the input a separate component â€” I meannn, thatâ€™s one of the many perks of using React ðŸ˜Œ.

The entire layout is styled with TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive look. 

Hereâ€™s what the form looks like so far:

<div className="flex gap-4 mt-6">
  <img src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/img1.png" className="w-1/2" />
  <img src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/img1.png" className="w-1/2" />
</div>
