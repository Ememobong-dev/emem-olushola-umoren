<div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
  <p>
    Iâ€™ve kicked things off by creating the layout for a simple form. To avoid
    repeating the same markup over and over, I made the input a separate
    component â€” I meannn, thatâ€™s one of the many perks of using React ðŸ˜Œ.
  </p>
  <p>
    The entire layout is styled with TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive
    look.{" "}
  </p>
</div>

Hereâ€™s what the code and form looks like so far:

<div className="flex gap-4 mt-6">
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/pageCode.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/inputComp.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>

<div className="flex justify-center mt-5">
  <img
    src="/images/articlesImages/form-validation/img1.png"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>

<div>
<p>Next up, I set up state management for the form using Reactâ€™s useState hook.</p>
</div>
